# logcrypt

  Logcrypt is an application that allows you to quickly and easily create secure logs or diary entries. I keep a log of all my ongoing projects, things that I learned while doing them, updates I made in them, planned upgrades, and ideas that I have and want to write down. My old method was using Kleopatra and my PGP keys to protect the files, but I wanted a faster, more efficient way to do this.
